      <h2>Privacy Policy – Boot Time</h2>
      <p><strong>Developer:</strong> Arnaldo Junior (I9Android)</p>

      <p>
        The <strong>Boot Time</strong> app is a utility that monitors the device reboot to display useful information to the user.
        It does not require login nor collect sensitive data.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Information Collection</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Boot Time</strong> <strong>does not collect personally identifiable information</strong>.

        <li>Show the system boot time;</li>

      </ul>

      <h3>4. Security</h3>
      <p>
        Because the app does not collect or transmit personal data, there is no risk of data leakage.
        All processing is done locally on the device.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Your Rights</h3>
      <p>
        You can uninstall the app at any time. No data is kept on external servers.

          <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank"
            >Firebase Privacy Policy</a
          >.

      <p>
        We retain your data while your account remains active and for up to 24
        months after the last interaction for backup, accounting and legal
        obligations. Event logs and advertising identifiers are kept for as long
        as needed for usage analysis, usually up to 13 months or as allowed by the
        platforms. You may request deletion, anonymization or portability by
        emailing
        <a href="mailto:arnaldo.araujo.dev@gmail.com"
          >arnaldo.araujo.dev@gmail.com</a

      <h3>6. Children and minors</h3>
      <p>
        Biblix is not directed to children and we do not knowingly collect data

          >arnaldo.araujo.dev@gmail.com</a
        > to request removal or blocking.
      </p>

      <h3>7. Security</h3>
      <p>
        We apply reasonable measures such as secure authentication, encryption in
        transit (HTTPS/TLS), access controls and anomaly monitoring within Google
        Firebase services. Despite our efforts, no storage or transmission method
        is 100% secure; we recommend keeping your credentials confidential and
        updating your devices regularly.
      </p>

      <h3>8. Your rights</h3>
      <p>Depending on the jurisdiction, you have the right to:</p>

          advertising purposes under the CCPA.

          Object to processing based on legitimate interest and request review of
          relevant automated decisions.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To exercise any right, send your request to
        <a href="mailto:arnaldo.araujo.dev@gmail.com"
          >arnaldo.araujo.dev@gmail.com</a

      <h3>9. International transfers</h3>
      <p>
        Google Firebase and Google services may process and store your data in
        data centers located outside your country of residence. We use standard
